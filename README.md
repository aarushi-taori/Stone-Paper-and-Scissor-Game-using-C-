# Stone-Paper-and-Scissor-Game-using-C++-

Rock Paper Scissor is a  game,in which each player simultaneously forms one of the three shapes.The winner of the game is decided as per the below rules:

i.) Rock vs Paper       -> Paper wins.
<br>ii.) Rock vs Scissor    -> Rock wins.
<br>iii.) Scissor vs Paper -> Scissor wins.

In this game, the user will be asked to make choice and according to the choice of user and computer the result will be displayed along with the choices.

**APPROACH**

The main function consists of declaration of variables. cout and cin functions are used for displaying the content and taking the input from the user.
Computerâ€™s choice is selected based on number generated by Random Module.

As the range is up to 100 only, the distribution among all the options i.e. , stone, paper, scissors is equal as all of them have equal probability of coming.

**RANDOM MODULE**

* It is an in-built module of C++ which is defined in header file <cstdlib>.
* rand() function used to generate random numbers in the range within a given range.

* Here, 1 is the offset. So, it will print numbers from 1 to 30.

**LEARNINGS**

* Implementing random module in the program.
<br>* Generating  Pseudo Random Numbers
<br>* Making combinations from different input choices of the user and computer.
<br>* Implementation of OOP techniques and Classes
